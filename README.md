# Digit Recognition

This is an implementation of a neural network used for digit recognition, using the MNIST dataset. The implementation is done **from scratch**, in the sense of we are not using any existing machine learning libraries.

## Structure and contents
An entire explanation and derivation of the project is kept entirely in the following [file](https://gitlab.com/guillermocreus98/digit-recognition/blob/master/NeuralNetwork_theory__1_.pdf).
This project was written entirely in [Python](https://www.python.org/) version 3.7. Several libraries from the standard library were used, and the latest version of the numpy library at current time, see [NumPy](https://numpy.org/).
